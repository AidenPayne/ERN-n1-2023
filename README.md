ERN data. Variables c and er are the subject-averaged ERPs for correct and error trials. Dimensions are electrodes (1-Fz, 2-FCz, 3-Cz) x subjects x time, corresponding to the time vector. 

Balance N1 data. Variable N1 contains the subject-averaged ERPs for the balance perturbation series. Dimensions are electrodes (same as ERNs) x subjects x time, corresponding to the time vector.
